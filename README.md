this is for assessment 3

The first assessment i did include doing:
customerbooking, which ment it it accessed the guest about their type of id and name and ticket
the total for service, which ment checking how much the guest wanted and how much they had to pay for it
the approval of the service, which made sure that the guest had enough for what they were buying and if they didn't would pend you
display the results, which would show everything form the previous examples.
